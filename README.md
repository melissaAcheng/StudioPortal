Project Description: A portal for private music teachers to write lesson notes/homework per student. Students can then log in and view notes.

New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn:

- Creating Registration and Login in MERN
- One-To-Many relationships using MongoDb and Mongoose
- Use Tailwind CSS

Week 1 Features (to show at Review during Week 2)

- Teacher and Student registration and login page with validations
- Protected routes (must be logged in to view pages)
- CRUD - Teachers can add students, assign lesson notes per student, edit and delete lesson notes
- Students can view lesson notes

Week 2 Features (to show at first office hour/lecture of Week 3)

- **_Finish CSS work (could be Bootstrap or another framework too instead of CSS)_**
- Teacher can add videos in lesson notes

Product Backlog (If I have more time after completing my MVP, I'll start to work on...)

- Student can add comments to lesson notes
- Practice log for students to keep track of when they practiced
